# Dataset

Confused by the dataset , soo many folders, so many files, Don't Worry I would be too, I will walk you through the dataset here
</br></br>
Lets start with all the folders and all their uses in the project

1. zip - It contains the csv files represented by the player name and corresponding country.</br>Each csv file contains
		 two columns having the match ids and the corresponding date at which the match was played
		 Now you might be confused as to what the match ids indicate and how do we get to know what match is being spoken about here , visit.Lets take a example
		 </br><br>
		 ```
		 Matches/MatchScorecard_ODI.asp?MatchCode=4114 
		 ```
		</br></br>
		 Place the above match id in the following link http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/ like this
		</br></br>
		http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard_ODI.asp?MatchCode=4114
		</br>	</br>
		Clicking on this link should take you to the respective scorecard of the match
		Similary its the same for all the matches, you can also find the list of each match name with their ids in the [allmatches.csv](https://github.com/lucasace/Best11-Fantasycricket/blob/master/allmatches.csv)
